# ðŸ”¥YouTube Playlist Downloader & Translator

This project automates several tedious steps involved in archiving and watching
YouTube content offline.  It can create or locate a playlist, download all
videos with subtitles and then translate the subtitles into your preferred
language.  The downloaded files are stored locally so they can be played back on
any device.

## Features

* **Playlist management** â€“ Create or locate a playlist on YouTube through the
  Data API and retrieve every video URL.  Alternatively you can provide the list
  of video URLs directly in `config.yaml`.
* **Video and subtitle downloader** â€“ Grab each video with
  [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), fetching subtitles in your target
  language when available or falling back to English.
* **Automatic subtitle translation** â€“ Any English subtitles are translated to
  the configured language using OpenAI, so you always end up with subtitles you
  can understand.
* **Resume support** â€“ Existing video files are detected and skipped, letting
  you rerun the script to only download what is missing.
* **Browser cookie authentication** â€“ When YouTube requires a signâ€‘in you can
  let yt-dlp reuse cookies from your browser so that even age-restricted videos
  can be downloaded seamlessly.

## Setup

1. Install Python dependencies with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it to point to your Google OAuth client secrets JSON. You can skip this step if `video_urls` is provided in the config.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env
```

3. Copy `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml` and edit it:
```bash
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
```

4. Adjust `config.yaml` to define either a `playlist_name` or a list of `video_urls`, along with the output directory and download options. If
   YouTube requests a sign-in to confirm you're not a bot, set `cookies_from_browser` under the
   `download` section to let yt-dlp authenticate using your browser cookies. The extracted
   cookies will be saved to `youtube_cookies.txt` in the project directory for reuse.
   Set `translate.force` to `true` if you want subtitles translated even when files in the target language already exist.
    Use `translate.entries_per_request` to batch multiple subtitle entries into a single OpenAI request.
    When a batch produces fewer translated lines than expected, the translator
    automatically halves the batch and retries until every line is translated or
    only single-line requests remain.

5. Run the helper to download videos and subtitles:

```bash
python main.py
```

After the download finishes, the script will automatically translate any English
subtitles to the configured target language using your OpenAI API key.

OAuth authentication is required on first run when using `playlist_name`. If `video_urls` are provided, the script skips Google login. Afterwards the script will print the playlist URL (if any), list the videos found and download each one with subtitles.

## Obtaining client_secrets.json file

**Note:** Obtaining the `client_secrets.json` file is only required when using `playlist_name` to access YouTube playlists. If you're only downloading individual videos using `video_urls`, you can skip this step.

The following steps are only required when using `playlist_name` to access the YouTube Data API.

1. Sign in to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and create a project.
2. Configure the consent screen in **APIs & Services â†’ OAuth consent screen** and add test users if necessary.
3. Go to **APIs & Services â†’ Credentials**, select **Create credentials â†’ OAuth client ID**, choose the application type and fill in redirect URIs.
4. After creation, click **Download JSON** in the popup to save the file. Name it `client_secrets.json`, or set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE` in `.env` to the correct path.
5. From April 2025 client secrets can only be downloaded at creation time, so regenerate them if lost.
6. Enable required Google APIs in **APIs & Services â†’ Library**.
